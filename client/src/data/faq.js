    question: 'Who can post to dev.to?',
    answer: 'Anyone! Yes, you have permission to make a new post of any kind as long as it meets our community guidelines and gets through common-sense spam filters. Your post is subject to removal at the discretion of the moderators if they believe it does not meet the requirements of our code of conduct.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I get featured on the home page?',
    answer: 'The home page is tailored to each individual DEV member based on what they are following. Every now and then, the DEV Team may "pin" a post to the homepage if it is an announcement that is relevant to all folks, but these are generally posts from the DEV Team.'

  {
    question: "Can I cross-post something I've already written on my own blog or Medium?",
    answer: "Absolutely, as long as you have the rights you need to do so! And if it's of high quality, we'll feature it."
